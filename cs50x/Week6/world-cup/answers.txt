Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: A relatively constant time would be obtained.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Depends on the fee but 10,000 would be good enough.
